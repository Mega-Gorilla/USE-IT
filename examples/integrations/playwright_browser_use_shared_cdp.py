"""
Advanced example showing Playwright and Browser-Use working together with custom actions.

This example demonstrates:
1. Starting Chrome with CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) enabled
2. Creating custom actions that use Playwright functions
3. Using Browser-Use AI to orchestrate the overall workflow
4. Both tools sharing the same browser session seamlessly

Dependencies: playwright, aiohttp, browser-use
