## Welcome to Browser Use Development!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mega-Gorilla/USE-IT
cd USE-IT
uv sync --all-extras --dev
# or pip install -U git+https://github.com/Mega-Gorilla/USE-IT.git@main
```

## Configuration

Copy the sample configuration and adjust API keys as needed:

```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
# or export keys directly in your shell:
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```


## Helper Scripts 
For common development tasks
```bash
# Complete setup script - installs uv, creates a venv, and installs dependencies
./bin/setup.sh

# Run all pre-commit hooks (formatting, linting, type checking)
./bin/lint.sh

# Run the core test suite that's executed in CI
./bin/test.sh
```



## Run examples

```bash
uv run examples/simple.py
```

## Use the GUI

Launch the desktop helper with:

```bash
uv run browseruse-gui
```

Changes you make in the GUI are written straight to `config.yaml` (project-local or the file under `~/.config/browseruse/`). Keep that YAML checked into version control only if it does not contain secretsâ€”otherwise manage keys via environment variables before starting the GUI.
