## Action Function Registration

To register your own custom functions (which can be `sync` or `async`), decorate them with the `@controller.action(...)` decorator. This saves them into the `controller.registry`.

```python
from browser_use import Controller, ActionResult

controller = Controller()

@controller.action('Ask human for help with a question', domains=['example.com'])   # pass allowed_domains= or page_filter= to limit actions to certain pages
def ask_human(question: str) -> ActionResult:
    answer = input(f'{question} > ')
    return ActionResult(extracted_content=f'The human responded with: {answer}', include_in_memory=True)
```

```python
# Then pass your controller to the agent to use it
agent = Agent(
    task='...',
    llm=llm,
    controller=controller,
)
```

<Note>
  Keep your action function names and descriptions short and concise:
  - The LLM chooses between actions to run solely based on the function name and description
  - The LLM decides how to fill action params based on their names, type hints, & defaults
</Note>
### Excluding Actions

If you want to exclude some registered actions and make them unavailable to the agent, you can do:

```python
controller = Controller(exclude_actions=['search_google'])
agent = Agent(controller=controller, ...)
```

<Note>
  The controller is stateless and can be used to register multiple actions and
  multiple agents.
</Note>

## Domain Restrictions

You can restrict actions to only run on specific domains or pages using the `allowed_domains` or `page_filter` parameters:

### Domain-Based Restrictions

```python
@controller.action('Fill out secret_form', allowed_domains=['https://*.example.com'])
def fill_out_form(...) -> ActionResult:
    # This action will only be runnable by LLM on pages that match https://*.example.com
    ...
```
